            <p class="part1text">I am a fourth-year student at the University of Cincinnati, enrolled in the Accelerated Engineering Degree program.
                 I will be graduating in May 2026 with both a B.S. and an M.Eng in Computer Science, along with a certificate in Software Engineering.
                 I am incredibly passionate about Data Science and have chosen it as the concentration for my masterâ€™s degree.

            <p class="part2text">During my academic semesters, I work as a tutor at Mason Best In Class Education Center and as a student ambassador at my university. 
                I am also involved in various different organisations and have held executive positions at organizations like IEEE, Association for Women of Color in Engineering (AWOCE),
                UC Piloting Club, Undergraduate Student Government and South Asian American Student Association (SAASA).

            <p class="part3text">Outside of school, work and extraciricullars, I like to go to the gym a lot and I like to try different fitness routines like Pilates, KickBoxing, Rock Climbinh,etc.
                I am not much of a runner and I am learning to do some cool tricks on my skateboars because as of now i can only turn and slide. I like tp go to abandoned buildings but not the ones reputed to be 
                haunted because I am spiritual and I get scared very easily.
